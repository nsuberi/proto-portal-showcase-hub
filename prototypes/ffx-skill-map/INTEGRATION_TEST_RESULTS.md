## Test Coverage

The automated integration test covers all critical scenarios:

### 1. Goal Setting and System Prompt Updates ✅
- **Test**: `should handle goal setting and system prompt updates correctly`
- **Verifies**: System prompt correctly includes goal information when a skill goal is set
- **Result**: PASSED

### 2. System Prompt Stability ✅  
- **Test**: `should maintain stable dependencies when path changes but goal remains same`
- **Verifies**: System prompt doesn't reset when mastered skills change but goal remains the same
- **Result**: PASSED
- **Key Insight**: This was the core issue - path recalculation no longer causes unnecessary resets

### 3. Goal Changes and Custom Preservation ✅
- **Test**: `should handle goal changes correctly while preserving custom behavior`
- **Verifies**: System prompt updates when actual goal changes, custom modifications preserved
- **Result**: PASSED

### 4. Unnecessary Re-render Prevention ✅
- **Test**: `should demonstrate the fix prevents unnecessary re-renders`
- **Verifies**: Callback pattern eliminates object reference dependency issues
- **Result**: PASSED

### 5. Complete Integration Flow ✅
- **Test**: `should verify complete integration flow matches manual test steps`
- **Verifies**: End-to-end workflow from goal setting to custom prompt preservation
- **Result**: PASSED

## Fix Validation

The tests confirm that the callback pattern fix successfully addresses:

### ✅ Root Cause Resolution
- **Issue**: Object reference changes in useEffect dependencies
- **Fix**: Callback pattern with stable references
- **Validation**: Dependencies change only when necessary

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- Goal setting works correctly
- System prompt updates appropriately 
- Custom user modifications are preserved
- Path recalculations don't cause resets

### ✅ Performance Improvements
- Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- Stable callback references
- Controlled dependency updates

## Technical Implementation Validated

### Interface Changes ✅
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
currentGoal?: { skill: Skill; path: string[] } | null;

// After (fixed)
getCurrentGoal?: () => { skill: Skill; path: string[] } | null;
```

### Dependency Management ✅
```typescript
// Before (object reference issues)
}, [employee.id, employeeId, currentGoal, allSkills]);

// After (stable references)
}, [employee.id, employeeId, allSkills, getCurrentGoal]);
```

### Optimized useCallback ✅
```typescript
// Precise dependency targeting
}, [selectedEmployeeId, characterGoals[selectedEmployeeId]]);
```

## Conclusion

The automated integration tests provide comprehensive validation that the JustInTimeWidget and SkillGoalWidget integration issue has been successfully resolved. The callback pattern fix:

1. **Maintains functionality** - All goal setting and system prompt features work correctly
2. **Prevents data loss** - User customizations are no longer lost during skill updates  
3. **Improves performance** - Eliminates unnecessary re-renders
4. **Follows best practices** - Matches established patterns in the codebase

The fix is production-ready and fully tested.
