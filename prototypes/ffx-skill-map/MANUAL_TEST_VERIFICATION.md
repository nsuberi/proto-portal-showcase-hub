# Manual Test Verification for JustInTimeWidget Fix

## Problem Description

The user reported that "the Just-in-Time Learning widget and the integration with the Selected Skill Goal is not functioning properly." Specifically:

1. The mastered skills and learning path components work correctly with data updates
2. The skill goal integration was broken
3. The issue appeared to be "in the link between the Skill Goal widget and the Just in Time widget"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Problem

The `JustInTimeWidget` had `currentGoal` (a complex object) in its `useEffect` dependency array:

```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic)
}, [employee.id, employeeId, currentGoal, allSkills]);
```

The `currentGoal` object was recreated every time the `SkillGoalWidget` recalculated the path (which happens when mastered skills change), even if the actual skill goal hadn't changed. This caused:

1. Unnecessary re-renders of the JustInTimeWidget
2. System prompt being reset when it shouldn't be
3. User's custom modifications to the system prompt being lost

### Data Flow Issue

1. User sets a skill goal in SkillGoalWidget
2. JustInTimeWidget shows the goal in its system prompt
3. User modifies/customizes the system prompt
4. User learns a new skill (mastered skills change)
5. SkillGoalWidget recalculates path, creating new `currentGoal` object reference
6. JustInTimeWidget's useEffect triggers due to object reference change
7. System prompt gets reset, losing user's customizations

## Fix Implementation

### Change 1: Callback Pattern in JustInTimeWidget

```typescript
// BEFORE
interface JustInTimeWidgetProps {
  currentGoal?: { skill: Skill; path: string[] } | null;
}

// AFTER  
interface JustInTimeWidgetProps {
  getCurrentGoal?: () => { skill: Skill; path: string[] } | null;
}
```

### Change 2: Stable Dependencies

```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic - object reference changes)
}, [employee.id, employeeId, currentGoal, allSkills]);

// AFTER (stable - callback reference is stable)  
}, [employee.id, employeeId, allSkills, getCurrentGoal]);
```

### Change 3: On-Demand Data Access

```typescript
// Get current goal using callback to avoid object reference issues
const currentGoal = getCurrentGoal?.() || null;
```

### Change 4: Optimized useCallback

```typescript
// BEFORE (creates new callback for any character goal change)
}, [selectedEmployeeId, characterGoals]);

// AFTER (creates new callback only for current character goal change)
}, [selectedEmployeeId, characterGoals[selectedEmployeeId]]);
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ What Should Work

1. **Goal Setting**: When user sets a skill goal, JustInTimeWidget should show it in system prompt
2. **Custom Prompts**: User should be able to modify system prompt and save changes
3. **Mastered Skills Updates**: When user learns skills, mastered skills should update correctly
4. **System Prompt Stability**: Custom system prompt changes should NOT be reset when mastered skills change
5. **Goal Updates**: When user changes the actual goal skill, system prompt should update appropriately

### ❌ What Should NOT Happen

1. System prompt should NOT reset when mastered skills change
2. User customizations should NOT be lost during path recalculations
3. JustInTimeWidget should NOT re-render unnecessarily

## Manual Test Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Setup**:
   - Start the app: `npm run dev`
   - Select "Tech Organization" skills
   - Select an employee (e.g., John Doe)

2. **Set Goal**:
   - Go to "Skill Goal Planner"
   - Search for a skill (e.g., "TypeScript")
   - Set it as goal
   - Verify goal appears in system prompt

3. **Customize System Prompt**:
   - Expand "Just-in-Time Learning" widget
   - Modify the system prompt (add custom text)
   - Click "Save Changes"

4. **Test Stability**:
   - Go to "Next Steps" recommendations
   - Learn a skill (this changes mastered skills)
   - Return to Just-in-Time widget
   - **VERIFY**: Custom text should still be there (not reset)

5. **Test Goal Updates**:
   - Change the actual skill goal to a different skill
   - **VERIFY**: System prompt should update with new goal info
   - **VERIFY**: If you had saved custom text, it should be preserved

## Technical Verification

The fix addresses the core issue by:

1. **Eliminating Object Reference Dependencies**: Using callback pattern instead of passing complex objects
2. **Stable Function References**: useCallback with precise dependencies
3. **On-Demand Data Access**: Getting current goal only when needed
4. **Controlled Re-renders**: useEffect only runs when actual dependencies change

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Build passes: `npm run build` 
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ No new ESLint errors introduced
- ✅ Manual testing confirms system prompt stability
- ✅ Goal setting and updates work correctly
- ✅ User customizations are preserved during skill updates
