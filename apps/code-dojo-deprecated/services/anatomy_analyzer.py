## Already Configured Topics (avoid these)

Identify patterns NOT in the already configured list. Focus on:
- Specific coding patterns used (decorators, context managers, error handling)
- Architectural decisions (routing, data flow, separation of concerns)
- Security or performance considerations visible in the code
- Interesting language features or library usage

Return JSON array with 2-4 patterns. Each pattern should have:
- name: Short descriptive name (2-4 words)
- description: One sentence explaining what this pattern does in their code
- suggested_analogy: A real-world analogy to help explain this concept

Example response format:
