# Challenge description for the API Auth challenge (Updated Section 1)
API_AUTH_CHALLENGE = """
## Challenge: Add API Authentication

The Snippet Manager API currently allows **anyone** to create, update, and delete code snippets without any authentication. This is a security vulnerability!

### Your Task

Add authentication to protect write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) while keeping read operations (GET) public.

### Requirements

1. **Choose an approach** - You can use any of these:
   - **API Key Authentication** - Using an `X-API-Key` header
   - **HTTP Basic Authentication** - Using `Authorization: Basic` header
   - **JWT (JSON Web Token)** - Using `Authorization: Bearer` header

2. **Protect write operations**:
   - POST `/api/snippets` (create)
   - PUT `/api/snippets/<id>` (update)
   - DELETE `/api/snippets/<id>` (delete)

3. **Keep read operations public**:
   - GET `/api/snippets` (list all)
   - GET `/api/snippets/<id>` (get one)
   - GET `/api/languages`
   - GET `/api/tags`

4. **Return proper error responses**:
   - 401 Unauthorized when credentials are missing or invalid
   - Include helpful error message

### Getting Started

1. Fork or clone the starter repository
2. Implement your authentication solution
3. Update the tests to verify auth works
4. Submit your solution branch

### Hints

- Look at how Flask decorators work
- Consider using `functools.wraps` for your decorator
- For API keys, `secrets.token_hex(32)` generates secure random keys
- For Basic Auth, werkzeug has password hashing utilities
- For JWT, consider using PyJWT library with HS256 signing
- Each approach has different tradeoffs (stateless vs simple, etc.)

### Success Criteria

- All existing tests still pass (read operations work without auth)
- New tests verify auth is required for write operations
- Invalid credentials return 401 with helpful message
- Valid credentials allow write operations

# Second learning goal: Claude API + LangSmith (Section 14)
CLAUDE_API_CHALLENGE = """
## Challenge: Build an AI-Powered Flask Endpoint

Create a Flask API endpoint that integrates with the Claude LLM API and
captures all interactions in LangSmith for observability.

### Your Task

Build a `/api/ask` endpoint that:
1. Accepts a question in the request body
2. Sends it to Claude for a response
3. Returns the AI-generated answer
4. Traces the entire interaction in LangSmith

### Requirements

1. **Choose an implementation approach**:
   - **Direct Anthropic SDK** - Using the official `anthropic` Python package
   - **LangChain Integration** - Using LangChain's ChatAnthropic wrapper
   - **Custom HTTP Client** - Using `requests` or `httpx` directly

2. **Implement proper error handling**:
   - Handle API rate limits gracefully
   - Return meaningful error messages
   - Log errors for debugging

3. **Add LangSmith tracing**:
   - Trace all LLM calls
   - Include metadata (model, tokens, latency)
   - Support trace grouping by session

4. **Environment configuration**:
   - API keys from environment variables
   - Configurable model selection
   - Tracing can be enabled/disabled

### Getting Started

1. Fork the starter repository
2. Set up your Anthropic and LangSmith API keys
3. Implement your solution
4. Submit your branch

### Hints

- For Anthropic SDK: `pip install anthropic`
- For LangChain: `pip install langchain langchain-anthropic`
- LangSmith tracing can be automatic with LangChain or manual with `@traceable`
- Consider using `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` environment variable

### Success Criteria

- Endpoint returns Claude's response correctly
- All calls appear in LangSmith dashboard
- Errors are handled gracefully
- No API keys in source code
